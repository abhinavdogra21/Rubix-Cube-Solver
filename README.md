# 3D Interactive Rubik's Cube Solver - Localhost Edition

A high-performance, localhost-optimized Rubik's Cube solver featuring 3D visualization, advanced Kociemba algorithm implementation, and intelligent session management. This project has been specifically designed for local development and deployment, eliminating the complexities and limitations of cloud hosting while providing optimal performance and reliability.

## üéØ Project Overview

This enhanced version of the Rubik's Cube Solver represents a significant evolution from cloud-dependent implementations to a robust, self-contained localhost solution. The project integrates Herbert Kociemba's renowned two-phase algorithm through a carefully optimized implementation that balances performance with resource efficiency, making it ideal for local development environments and personal use.

The solver addresses common issues found in cloud-deployed cube solvers, including state management problems, session persistence, and the challenges of handling large pruning tables in resource-constrained environments. By focusing on localhost deployment, we've eliminated network latency, reduced dependency on external services, and provided users with complete control over their solving environment.

## üîß Architecture & Implementation

### System Architecture

The Rubik's Cube Solver employs a modern three-tier architecture optimized for localhost deployment:

**Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
- Built with modern JavaScript and WebGL for 3D rendering
- Responsive design supporting both desktop and mobile interfaces
- Real-time communication with backend via RESTful APIs
- Local state management for optimal user experience

**Application Layer (Backend)**
- Flask-based REST API server with CORS configuration for localhost
- Enhanced Kociemba solver with session management capabilities
- Intelligent caching and state persistence
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Algorithm Layer (Core Solver)**
- Integration of muodov's Kociemba implementation for reliability
- Custom session management for multi-user scenarios
- Optimized data structures for fast cube state manipulation
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

### Enhanced Kociemba Implementation

The core of our solving capability lies in the enhanced Kociemba implementation, which represents a significant improvement over traditional approaches:

**Algorithm Optimization**
The two-phase algorithm implementation has been carefully optimized for localhost deployment. Unlike cloud-based solutions that must minimize memory usage due to hosting constraints, our localhost approach allows for intelligent caching and pre-computation strategies that significantly improve solving performance.

**Session Management**
One of the key innovations in this implementation is the comprehensive session management system. Each solving session maintains its own state, including:
- Current cube configuration
- Last applied scramble
- Solution history
- Timestamp tracking for automatic cleanup

This approach eliminates the state management issues commonly found in stateless web applications, where subsequent requests might interfere with each other or lose important context.

**Memory Management**
The enhanced solver implements intelligent memory management that balances performance with resource usage. Rather than loading massive pruning tables (which can exceed 4GB in some implementations), our approach uses a hybrid strategy that combines smaller lookup tables with runtime computation for optimal performance on typical desktop hardware.

### API Design & Endpoints

The backend API has been designed with localhost deployment in mind, providing comprehensive functionality while maintaining simplicity:

**Core Solving Endpoints**
- `POST /api/solve`: Solve cube from state string with session support
- `POST /api/solve_scramble`: Solve scramble sequence with proper Kociemba algorithm
- `GET /api/scramble`: Generate random scrambles with corresponding cube states
- `POST /api/validate`: Validate cube state configurations

**Session Management Endpoints**
- `POST /api/session/clear`: Clear session state for fresh start
- `GET /api/session/info`: Retrieve current session information
- Session-aware solving with automatic state tracking

**Health & Monitoring**
- `GET /`: Health check with system status and feature availability
- Comprehensive error reporting with detailed diagnostic information
- Performance metrics and timing information

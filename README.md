## üîß Architecture & Implementation

### System Architecture

The Rubik's Cube Solver employs a modern three-tier architecture optimized for localhost deployment with cross-platform compatibility:

**Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
- Built with modern JavaScript and WebGL for 3D rendering
- Responsive design supporting both desktop and mobile interfaces
- Real-time communication with backend via RESTful APIs
- Local state management for optimal user experience

**Application Layer (Backend)**
- Flask-based REST API server with CORS configuration for localhost
- Custom Kociemba solver with advanced session management capabilities
- Intelligent caching and state persistence
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Algorithm Layer (Custom Solver)**
- Proprietary C++ implementation of the two-phase algorithm
- Multi-threading support for enhanced performance
- Optimized data structures for fast cube state manipulation
- Cross-platform compilation with platform-specific optimizations

### Custom Kociemba Implementation

The core of our solving capability lies in our proprietary Kociemba implementation, which represents a significant advancement over traditional approaches:

**Algorithm Optimization**
Our two-phase algorithm implementation has been carefully optimized for localhost deployment across multiple platforms. Unlike cloud-based solutions that must minimize memory usage due to hosting constraints, our localhost approach allows for intelligent caching and pre-computation strategies that significantly improve solving performance.

**Session Management**
One of the key innovations in this implementation is the comprehensive session management system. Each solving session maintains its own state, including:
- Current cube configuration
- Last applied scramble
- Solution history with timing information
- Timestamp tracking for automatic cleanup
- Cross-session state isolation

This approach eliminates the state management issues commonly found in stateless web applications, where subsequent requests might interfere with each other or lose important context.

**Cross-Platform Performance**
The custom solver implements platform-specific optimizations:
- **macOS**: Optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures
- **Linux**: Leverages advanced compiler optimizations and threading
- **Windows**: Compatible with Visual Studio build tools and MinGW

### API Design & Endpoints

The backend API has been designed with localhost deployment in mind, providing comprehensive functionality while maintaining simplicity:

**Core Solving Endpoints**
- `POST /api/solve`: Solve cube from state string with session support
- `POST /api/solve_scramble`: Solve scramble sequence with custom Kociemba algorithm
- `GET /api/scramble`: Generate random scrambles with corresponding cube states
- `POST /api/validate`: Validate cube state configurations

**Session Management Endpoints**
- `POST /api/session/clear`: Clear session state for fresh start
- `GET /api/session/info`: Retrieve current session information
- Session-aware solving with automatic state tracking

**Health & Monitoring**
- `GET /`: Health check with system status and feature availability
- Comprehensive error reporting with detailed diagnostic information
- Performance metrics and timing information
